Hello. My name is Hugo. I am a 24 years old Risk Analyst with a master's in Finance from Nova SBE. This GitHub contains some academic and personal projects developed throughout the degree, presented as follows:

a) ML Credit Default Prediction Model: In this project, under the Machine Learning subject at Nova SBE, the goal was to create a predictive algorithm that identified the creditworthiness of clients taking into account features such as age, income, wealth and nationality.

b) Berkshire Hathaway portfolio analysis: Project under the Asset Management course with the purpose of evaluating Berkshire's Portfolio in relation to certain benchmarks. In addition to this, a minimum variance portfolio was also computed using a shrinkage estimator of the covariance matrix. 

c) Quantitative investment Strategy: This was a project under the Data Analytics for Finance subject at Nova SBE. The objective was to create and evaluate the performance of a quantitative investment strategy using the f# programming language.

d) Poker Probability Calculator: A personal and simple project that i created due to my passion for playing poker. It calculates the probability of winning the pot in a post-flop situation.
